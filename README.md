Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
Answer: There are few transactions which have caused the data to be skewed such as shop_id =42 and user_id=607 are having multiple big transactions so average is around 3145.13, but as they are multiple transaction anomaly is ruled out. When can either remove such transaction or change the measure. Median would be a better measure as compared to mean as we would get a better picture of how the shops are performing. 



b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
Answer: Median order value
c.	What is its value?
Answer: 284
